<br><br><h4 id="cengage-backgroud">Background</h4><br>

<br>I was fortunate to be selected by Cengage to leave my footprints on one of their products. After all, nothing is more exciting for a UX researcher than being offered with the chances to impact a product in its early stage. <br>

<br>Cengage is investing a lot of resources in their vision to refine research processes, particularly in the field of digital humanities (DH). They launched a group of talents, led by Bret, and formed a start-up like agile environment within their corporation to bring this vision to fruitation. So when Bret approached my team and I for UX recommendations, we said yes without any doubts.<br>

<br>The risk for this product, however, is stiff: the field of digital humanities is so new that no shared mental model has been established among the users, including DH scholars, students and librarians, etc. This poses a great challenge for Bret and his team, as they could not efficiently cater their product design to their users. Naturally, developers and designers will thus rely on their intuitions and knowledge of other products, aka educated guesses. Yet, this turned out to be more or less problematic.<br>


<br><br><br><h4 id="cengage-interaction-map">Interaction map and broken workflow</h4><br>

<br>I started my work by examining current workflow offered by the product. To do so, my team and I mapped out an interaction map, assuming the user is a first-time customer interacting with the system.<br>

<br><img src="img/research/interaction-map.jpg" alt="the interaction map of Cengage HD Sandbox" style="width: 100%;"><br><figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;">Interaction map and the actual workflow on users' end</figcaption><br>

<br><img src="img/research/intended-workflow.png" alt="the intended workflow pictured by the client" style="width: 100%;"><br><figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;">the intended high-level workflow pictured by the client</figcaption><br>

<br>It turns out that the map does not coincide with the ideal workflow as expected by Bret and his team. More specifically, this beta version does not do well in walking users through the intended steps that are required to perform a text mining task. <br>

<br>For instance, the application wanted users to create a “project” object first before inserting text into the system for later analysis. The intention is to create a better knowledge organization within the application for the users. Yet, instead, in the beta version, users are given options to skip this step and jump directly to other steps. Such a discrepancy between intended workflow and actual workflow is caused by missing visual guidance as well as loosely designed information architecture.<br>

<br>Consequently, my team recommended the client with a revision on the visual clues, coupled with restructuring of existing information architecture.<br>

<br><br><br><h4 id="cengage-interview">Interview and understanding the business</h4><br>

<br>With the interaction map, my team and I have identified the first step for our project. However, rather than rushing into other user research tasks, we believe we need to understand business drivers first, in order to gain a complete picture of the product.<br>

<br>For next week, I will lead the stakeholder interviews with client, subject matter experts and customers. I will update my findings here once the qualitative data analysis is completed.<br>

<br>You designed an awesome application. You have been working on it days and nights for past three months and you are confident that users will just flood in. So you worked hard to prepare for the first week, thinking it will be the peak of registration. Plus, you wanted to leave a good impression to your users. Hence you bought five Monster energy drinks and sat in front of your screen, waiting for your inbox to be packed with users’ questions or feedback. The only problem, you later realized, was that it didn’t happen.<br>

<br>I had a similar experience too, not as a developer or a project manager, but as a teaching assistant. Back in graduate school, I had a chance to teach a relevantly difficult class. As a courtesy, I emphasized again and again in the introduction session about the importance of utilizing my office hours to get help on homework and class materials. Surprisingly (or in this case, not surprisingly), my first office hours turned out to be a bit quiet --- I sat in my office for 2 hours with just my laptop. As a matter of fact, all my office hours in the first month remained unvisited by any undergraduate students, ironically allowing me to finish Steve Job’s biography. Good for me, terrible for my students and the program I worked for.<br>

<br>This was why I didn’t even hesitate to take Girls on the Run as my client for 2016 Ann Arbor Data Dive. Kelly, their Operation Coordinator at the Southeastern Michigan council, briefed me that her organization had been having a hard time to provide financial aids to their participants, because enrollment was rolling-based and thus it was hard for her to prepare budget for the users, due to their seemly chaotic registration patterns. For a NGO whose financial resources are not as affluent as large firms, and who constantly needs to make accurate budgets on monthly or weekly basis, this is the worst as it could be. After all, how can one know the amount of money to prepare if he or she doesn’t know how many people will join the program.<br>

<br><img src="img/data-dive-cup.jpg" alt="A gift from Data Dive" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%;"><br><figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;">A gift from Data Dive</figcaption><br>

<br>I led a team of four to try to tackle this issue. The process, as a matter of fact, turns out to be quite fun by itself, and, fortunately, I managed to pick up some interesting observations.<br>

<br>My team begun the process by sitting down with the client learning their expectations and their insights amassed over the past decade --- I am a big fan of prior knowledge and using them to inform research design and data analysis. The dataset I obtained from my client was both comprehensive and challenging, in a sense that it was relevantly structured yet inconsistent over time. The organizers at the client side used to rely on interns to input and maintain data of their program participants, but the hiring difficulties in recent time made it almost impossible for the organizers to use consistent methods to code and store data. Such a shift in organizational process eventually resulted in data analysis and cleaning challenges, as misspellings and misplacement were frequently discovered in the dataset. <br>

<!-- <img src="" alt="dataset of misspelling data" style="width: 100%;"><br><figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;">Dataset of misspelling data</figcaption><br> -->

<br>Yet, I still find the dataset informative, due to the fact that it includes a comprehensive list of program participants between 2014-2016 with their behavioral and socioeconomic data. Therefore, before committing to modeling or full blown data analysis, I conducted visualization to gain some high-level knowledge from the dataset.<br>

<br><img src="img/research/data-dive-tableau.png" alt="pictures of visualization, tableau + python" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%;"><br><figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;">Visualization: Tableau + Python</figcaption><br>

<br>Some exploratory visualization convinces me that one of the most crucial factors correlated with my client’s weekly expenditure is registration number. As shown above, the overall descending trend emerges among both program registration numbers and scholarship spending---a combined variable from two major sources of program costs namely price adjustment and discount, as coded by my client. What this says is that the program may have been experiencing an overall peak/off season transition from January to April in 2015, or even every year. More importantly, this points out my research direction: to understand the mechanisms that give rise to the gap between the demand for money and actual spending. <br>

<br><img src="img/research/data-dive-sites.png" alt="picture of visualization, particularly related to differences among the counties" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%;"><br><figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;">Visualization: differences among the counties</figcaption><br>

<br>Further explorative analysis reveals that, space is also a significant factor when deciding financial allocation for my client. It turns out that the client organization has their program operating concurrently in five counties in Southeastern Michigan, spreading across over dozens of facilities. The performance of those sites, largely determined by their ability to attract large registration as well as their capability of offering enough scholarship to maintain certain number of active participants, thus differ greatly too. What I observed from the dataset was that the difference in social structure and social conditions may incur the fluctuations of financial demand across the program sites in the five counties. Some explanatory regression analysis also echoes this point by demonstrating a strong statistical correlation between household income and the amount of scholarship received by the families. This, coupled with many other hypothesized social factors, compels me to believe that, in order to help my client to better understand their financial situation, I need to delve into the details of the data so that a greater picture could be revealed.<br>

<br>Hence I concluded that my mission for Data Dive is to discover possible models, - either descriptive, predictive or prescriptive - in order to understand the temporal and spatial variation in the financial demand faced by my client organization. <br>

<br>The day of the Dive turned out to be even more fun than I expected. Before the Dive was officially kicked on, I had the fortune to deliver a 5-minutes pitch with my preliminary findings. The pitch, to my surprise, yielded an overwhelmingly positive feedback, and I successfully attracted a room of roughly 20 volunteers to work on the project. By the insights I have gained from my explorative analysis, I divided the volunteers into two major groups: one for temporal analysis and one for spatial analysis. Knowing the power of visualization as well as the time constrains (the Data Dive runs from 9 to 7, leaving only 5-8 effective hours to play around with the data), I encouraged my teams to start with explorative visualization and then proceed to hypothesizing or model building and selection. Additionally, I opened the floor to all thoughts and ideas from my teams, since I deeply understand that everyone has his or her own take on how to approach the data, and sparks come from unexpected combination of knowledge --- after all, this event of Data Dive is not only about me and my client, but also about everyone having fun from diving the data while learning and supporting each other.<br>

<br>At the end of the day, I had four teams working on distinct projects. I have to be honest, despite running around helping different teams on their projects --- or at least I tried to --- I learned way more from them that the help they got from me. I was deeply touched by the devotion of my teams and their generosity of donating their time and data skills to do social good. This was why I invited my teams to present their findings in my final presentation, because I wanted them to own their work, to be proud of it, and, if appropriate, to brag about it on dinner table. I learned so much valuable knowledge that I want to share the following three with you (all pictures and findings are credited to me and my teams).<br>
<br>

<br><br><br><h4>Importance of “0”</h4><br>

<br><img src="img/research/data-dive-zip1.png" alt="mapping of performance of sites by zipcode" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%;"><br>
<br><img src="img/research/data-dive-zip2.png" alt="mapping of performance of sites by zipcode" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%;"><br>

<br>One of my teams took efforts to map different sites by zip codes. This was such a feat as the dataset was unbelievably fragmental and the data structure and data types were inconsistent across different years. As a matter of fact, we even managed to crush Tableau several times when importing the data (errors reported to Tableau already. I have no idea if they were caused by unsupported data types). <br>

<br>The result was magnificent. The mapping was detailed enough that my client was amazed by the performance difference among different sites. Plus, she only provided us with the county code for those sites. It was interesting to see how detailed information emerged when breaking larger affiliation into smaller ones, and how rich details could inform better decision making.<br>

<br>One interesting problem the team ran into was the white spots in the map. Besides several blank spots which were caused by public facilities, such as airports, the team questioned why my client was doing particularly poor in several areas. So they brought the question to me and we started to hypothesize. After ten minutes of failed hypothesizing, I suddenly recalled that my client mentioned briefly in our first meeting that they faced some competition with other programs. So the blank spots in the map were not a result of poor organizational performance. Instead, it was caused by strategic retreat in those areas to avoid unnecessary competition. Guess it was equally important to study the “0” in dataset as the “1.” After all, to understand why a river has certain curvature in watercourse, one needs to understand the mountains that block the way.<br>

<br><br><br><h4>Failure is the beginning of success, for next iteration</h4><br>

<br>Another team works diligently on constructing a predictive model for the financial need, given the data contains information from 2014-2016. However, my preliminary findings indicate that such a wish could lead to no robust models, as the dataset was “small” in a sense that it only contains a relevantly short time span and limited variation within the dataset, even if it records three years of data. I expressed my concern to my team and encouraged them to explore rather than overfitting the model.<br>

<br>As a result, my concern was proven to be true. We observed somewhat strong multi-collinearity in the regression model, indicating high redundancy of information in the model. Additionally, we could not provide sound explanation of variation in the model, which we suspect were caused by unknown error terms and exogenous variables. We even tried to use Bayesian models but could not find a good pattern.<br>

<br>Yes, we failed in this round, but both my client and my team benefitted tremendously. After some conversation with my client, she agreed to try to release more data to use for analysis purpose and my team showed interests in continue this research in the future. Like all iterative process, failure of one time does not mean anything personal. It is the future iteration that will bring us closer to the expected research result. In this sense, failure of this round is just the beginning of success.<br>
<br>

<br><br><br><h4>Correlation is fun. Causation is the meat</h4><br>

<img src="img/research/data-dive-race1.png" alt="map of scholarship distribution by race" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%;"><br>
<img src="img/research/data-dive-race2.png" alt="map of scholarship distribution by race" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%;"><br>
<figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;">Scholarship distribution by race. FRLP = Free/Reduced Lunch Program, which serves as a proxy<br> for measurement of socioeconomic conditions in different geographical areas.</figcaption><br>

<br>Another team also attacked the mapping issue, but from a different perspective. They looked at the distribution of scholarship among different ethnic groups, in order to examine any systematic errors in scholarship distributions. <br>

<br>The map, as a matter of fact, seems to support the claim that scholarship is unevenly distributed among races. However, it was too early to make any robust conclusion about race-based institutional discrimination of scholarship allocation. Both my client and I treated this finding very seriously, and we formed a small discussion about the issue. We further dived into the race composition within different counties where my client’s program operates, yet we could not find any evidence that demonstrates it was race that caused this difference in scholarship allocation pattern. What seemed more appropriate to explain this correlation was that counties which have low percentage of minority races naturally gave less amount of scholarship to these groups, as there were less of them entered the program and requested for scholarship. In other words, it may well be that the race did not cause less scholarship amount. Instead, race and scholarship were both confounded by demographic features of different counties. In this case, a better measurement of scholarship allocation may be scholarship per capita so that the weight given to certain races could be averaged out.<br>

<br>Guess this quote never gets old: correlation does not equal causation. <br>

<br>There are other interesting challenges I ran into, such as scoping, power balancing and cross-team spirit building. Due to space limits, I can’t elaborate on every single of these aspects. But I am more than happy to talk about them as well as the personal growth I have gained form serving as a project manager and a data specialist for my client. Just shoot me an email!

<br><br><br><h4 id="an-interview-with-indie-game-developer">Using silence: An interview with an indie-game developer</h4>

<br>"Shut up and let your interviewees talk."<br>

<br>This was one of the funniest and most educational quotes I heard when I was at the University of Chicago receiving my sociology/anthropology research trainings. For countless seconds, it is this sentence that helps me to hold my impulsion to interrupt my interviewees when I feel them drifting away from the topic. It is also this same quote that constantly proves the point that no words are waste of time for an in-depth interview.<br>

<br>One example was about my interview with an Australian game developer L. As a participant of Innovation Trek, and a diehard fan of RPG and indie games, I was deeply interested to develop a device, either digital or off-line, to facilitate indie game development. Such a goal requires a better understanding of the difficulties that indie game developers are facing. Through some networking and careful recruiting, L and I had a long conversation about his developer life and pain points.<br>

<br>L was a very gentle soul and extremely generous sharing his stories. We chatted about conflicts in his development team and his relationship with his families, and eventually focusing on his thoughts on the biggest pain point. I asked:<br>

<br>“If you could go back time and change one thing for your project, what would that be?”<br>

<br>The question is personal and straight-forward, yet it is powerful in terms of eliciting regretful emotions from my interviewees, which could direct me to their biggest pain point. To my surprise, L responded within milliseconds:<br>

<br>“Manpower. Definitely manpower.”<br>

<br>I was not sure if this quick-response was something that constantly tortured L, or something he had prepared for my interview (though the latter looked unseemly). What I was sure about was that our conversion was later dominated by the topic of labor. Or in this case, lack of labor.<br>

<br>Me: “You need more people.”<br> 
L: “Oh yes, oh yes.”<br>

<br>It turned out that L was very admirable about No Man’s Sky’s approach: using algorithms to generate contents so that programmers do not have to worry about them. However, when I asked L to specify what of manpower he desired, I detected something nested within his request for more human labor.<br>

<br>Me: “What kind of Manpower you’re speaking of?”<br>
L: “Whatever you can think of.”<br>
Me: “No priorities [laugh]?”<br>
L: “Yeah… as priority, we probably need another programmer.  Just because it’s a big program and there’re lots of pieces.”<br>
Me: “So someone to get the dirty work done [laugh]?”<br>

<br>At this point, it was clear that L’s needs were beyond just a coder. By the tone he described the shortage of human labor, I realized the need for specialists in his team must be multi-faceted. Yet I didn’t jump to the question about if he needed additional creative staff member or a visual designer, since that will not only produce a leading question, but also pose the risk of evaporating the sympathetic bond we built. More importantly, I wanted our conservation to focus on his needs and pain points, not third-party suggestions. So kept silent for a short moment.<br>

<br>Me: “[silence]…”<br>
<br>L: “[laugh and then silence] … we could also use a marketer.”<br>

<br>Silence works. The intentional silence and temporary pause I put in our conversation convinced my interviewee that it was still his turn to say something. Even better, that “something” should be personal enough to break the silence and refocus our chat. L continued:<br>

<br>“… Like that would be cool… We realized that now we started getting out to the world, like going on to the forums, emailing people, talking to YouTube. It takes a lot of time. It’s a full workday.” 
“Most indie developers… have great ideas about games. Very few, though, know how to market their games.”<br>

<br>Now this is the meat of our conversation. It gives me a clue how my interviewee perceives himself and his biggest pain point, but also the indie developers as a group. Yet, more interesting details hide in his following words.<br>

<br>L: “A marketing forum that everybody knows that it exists [for indie developers]. Something like Facebook Indie Game page would most definitely be helpful.”<br>

<br>It was a great answer from L. But my gut told me that there was something more in this Facebook idea. Facebook, generally speaking, is more or less a personal space to generate close bonds or share intimate information. Though it is not rare to see businesses use Facebook as a marketing platform, recent trends also compel me to believe that Facebook is starting to view itself differently than just a content discovery service. Yet, it is fundamentally interesting to see an indie game developer, who highly desires business success, chooses Facebook over other professional channels as the first stop to promote his game. So I asked:<br>

<br>“[Silence]… why Facebook?”<br>

<br>Again, I placed an intentional short period of silence. At this point, it was doubtful that both my interviewee and I would go deep into the topic of marketing. Even if marketing was apparently a big issue for L, it might be too much for the overall purpose of the interview. A short silence helped me to stop the stream of business discussions and bring back L’s personal feelings, before our conservation slipping into a marketing brainstorm session. Additionally, a short pause pulled my interviewee’s attention out of his future plans and refocus his attention to the present.<br>  

<br>L: “I’m kind of a huge fan of Facebook. The truth is that it is a very clean website that is very pleasant for everybody… I actually want to make a website like that.”<br>

<br>It is good to know that L has a strong feeling about Facebook, yet the question of “Why Facebook” is still not answered. Yes, L was right about Facebook that many people enjoyed it greatly, but his answer was not personal enough, logical maybe. I sensed there was a big reason behind L’s motivation of choosing Facebook, something emotional and powerful to make him overlook the benefits of professional marketing platforms. So I didn’t interrupt his speech.<br>

<br>Me: “… [silence]”<br>
L: “… But if there could be some sort of a centralized form of a marketing device that is visited by developers and gamers alike, it will be, yeah, a great tool.”<br>
Me: “so, to some extent, it’s like a community right?”<br>
L: “Exactly.”<br>

<br>Now there we go. What L liked about Facebook was not just about Facebook’s clean design or large user base, but its sense of community. A community forged by not only developers, but also gamers. A community where L could have fun and grow together with his audience while promoting and refining his games. This was why L chose Facebook favorably over LinkedIn or YouTube as his marketing platform. For L, business builds upon social relations. This was confirmed by our conversation later:<br>

<br>L: “It’s more than just making games… With [gamers’] feedback of what you want to see in a game. Things like that…”<br>
L: “… It’s a kind of organic game development. It’s a process where it’s not just what you get out from your head [regarding ideas about games], but also it’s what you get out of the public’s head. If we hear criticisms over and over from the gamers, then clearly the public is onto something we missed and we need to implement it.”<br>
Me: “So it’s a channel to connect supply and demand.”<br>
L: “Absolutely. A dire channel.”<br>

<br>It becomes clearer and clearer that what social relations mean to indie game developers like L. On top of getting connected with his audience, L also needs the social relations to verify his concepts of his games. To a degree, the “marketing” as mentioned by L is significantly different from the conventional narratives. Instead, it is closer to what UX professionals know of usability testingt and post-development feedback, which heavily relies on strong and reliable relationship with the users to gain authentic and meaningful feedback.<br>

<br>This claim makes perfect sense. Indie game developers, unlike their colleagues in big corporations, lack resources to do user research, either before, during or after development. Without concrete knowledge of what their audience needs, the only source of confidence they can rely on is their intuition to produce a big hit game. Therefore, many indie game developers like L constantly live under fear. The term “marketing” for them is generalized to mean almost anything unrelated to development, as it’s usually not their area of expertise. What “marketing” really means, in this case, is about testingt and feedback collection. With such information, I went on to suggest my team at Innovation Trek to focus on the “feedback” side of marketing, as our product should focus on helping indie game developers easily collect user feedback --- their biggest pain point.<br>

<br><br><br><h4 id="silence-in-prototype-testing">Silence in prototype testingt</h4>

<br>
<div class="video-container">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4NZzPQcwac8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen class="video"></iframe>
</div>
Another example of using silence is to collect useful data of how users interact with prototypes.<br>
<br>

<br>On the way to develop a mobile application to solve Ann Arbor’s parking issues, I produced a paper prototype for potential users to test on. After the test was started, I provided limited to no instructions about how the paper prototype would or should work, even if when the tester was stuck. The point is to simulate the scenario where users need to finish a task without any instructions. If the paper prototype survives the test and the user is able to complete the given task without any help, then the prototype at least makes some sense.<br>

<br>Why complete silence? Why no instructions at all? Why bother to isolate the test completely when in reality users are able to get instructions via just a simple google search? Indeed, the cost to obtain information is very low in this digital age, and it does not break a sweat for users to perform a simple search about how to use a thing. But that brief moment where users need to be dragged away from the product and resort to third party sources may cost the product team a permanent customer. The best design, if possible, should be something requires no instruction. It should be something self-contained without external help. It should just work. Silence, in this case, may help the researcher find those lethal design mistakes at the lab, before the product was released to the market.<br>

        <h4 class="modal-title" id="myModalLabel">Genesis of organizational forms</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="modal-body no-an">
<br><br>Summary:<br>
<ol>
    <li>I will forever be a sociologist. It's one of my deepest identities.</li>
    <li>When context demands, research design needs to be flexible and creative.</li>
    <li>Curiosity is my food. Love of thinking is my oxygen. </li>
    <li>Project outcome: I designed a creative method to collect “hard” data in China, by mixing interviews, surveys and web crawlers. My advisor was well pleased.</li>
</ol><br>

<br>Chicago has a special place in my heart. I gained my intellectual identity and I had the fortune to study with the best advisor I could have. Professor John Padgett, to whom I owe impossible to return favors, used his magic and somehow infested me with his passion about using multiple networks to understand social change and innovations. Under his guidance, I set out to empirically examine the formation of organizational forms using Chinese environmental NGOs as examples, which turned out to be quite tricky and fun.<br>

<br>Why research the genesis of organizational forms? What I can assure you is that it’s not something insignificant or something people study for the sake of studying. As a matter of fact, the literature of organizational learning, inter-organizational knowledge transfer as well as their theoretical and statistical models are countless, but much efforts were put to ask the question of where do those forms and knowledge come from in the first place. If you dive yourself into the universe of complex system research or alike, you may agree that initial conditions are one of the crucial elements for a system, due to its non-linearity, self-organization and emergence properties. Therefore, to study how a system works, I need to study its initial stage.<br>

<br>This is why I selected Chinese environmental NGOs as my samples. They are generally young, active, fast-changing and have high turnover rate --- all of which indicate this field is in its infancy. I believed that documenting, understanding and analyzing this stage of development will capture valuable data from the inter-organizational relations, and will contribute to future study of organizational research. <br>

<br><br><br><h4>Mixed-methods Research Design and Creative Data Collection</h4><br>

<br>Hence I designed a mixed method research to reach this objective. The goal is, by mixing different data collection and analysis methods, I could get most out of the data I gathered and later produce sound inferences. Another reason is due to the difficulties of collecting data in China or China-related topics. Mixing various data collection methods helped me to gain access to data sources that were uneasy to be detected using single data collection technique.<br>

<br>For instance, I mixed a web crawler and targeted surveys to reconstruct social relations and interactions among Chinese environmental NGOs. As the civil society sector in China is still ambivalently viewed by the government, many of the Chinese environmental NGOs developed sensitivity to certain political or social topics. This suspicious attitude, coupled with high death and turnover rates in the field, makes it tremendously difficult for a researcher to pinpoint certain organizations, let alone collecting data from them.<br> 

<br>To overcome such an issue, I wrote a python script that parsed out contact and communication methods of Chinese environmental NGOs from three major recruiting sites for civil society organizations in China. The data gathered were later stored locally in a relational database on my laptop. This not only guaranteed that the contact information is most up-to-date, but also helped me filter out organizations that were inactive or even closed down. Using these contact information, I was able to compose targeted survey invitation to my research subjects and achieve relevantly high response rate.<br>

<br><img src="img/research/network-multiple.png" alt="multiple networks" style="width: 100%;"><br><figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;">Visualization: multiple networks. This graph of multiple networks was constructed by four social relations among Chinese environment NGOs: Financial aid (NGOs who receive/give financial aid to each other), Information exchange (sharing information with each other), support network (When help is needed, which organization will be contacted) and collaboration (joint projects/programs). Visualization was made possible by muxViz version 1.0.5 (Domenico, Porter and Arenas 2015) https://github.com/manlius/muxViz. Each node represents an indiviadual NGO, and the vertrcies are directed. The multiplex networks in this graph were constructed in accordance with betweenness centrality of each node, on the basis of Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed layout. </figcaption><br>

<br>The returned survey helped me to map out above sociogram of inter-organizational networks of Chinese environmental NGOs. I explored different perspectives and algorithms to draw such a four-layered multiple networks. One of the most significant conclusions I reached from this graph was about the severe uneven distribution of resources among these NGOs. Additionally, it seems that resource availability seems to be correlated with the centrality level one organization occupies in the field, which was confirmed by statistical tests* (more details can be found in my paper).<br>

<br><img src="img/research/network-financial.png" alt="multiple networks" style="width: 60%; margin-left: 20%"><br><figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;">Financial Status of Chinese environmental NGOs in the Collaboration network. Nodes in blue are environmental NGOs<br> with sufficient funding, while red nodes denote those with low funding for operations. Grey nodes are non-surveyed<br> environmental NGOs identified by sample members.</figcaption><br>

<br>Following up is involved interviewing targeting the survey respondents. Through connecting with target audience via consistent communication, I developed close relationships with my interviewees. The interviews provided me with thick and rich data about the operations and organizational challenges my interviewees were facing, among which was the incentives and motivations behind the formation of their organizational forms. Empathy and meaningful interpretation helped me untangle complex reasoning behind such an issue.<br>

<br>At the end of the thesis, I concluded that the resource scarcity in the field drove Chinese environmental NGOs to depart from each other --- and formed clusters along the way. I further observed that four major types of organizations emerged from such a field and this dictated their organizational structures. I further hypothesized that such a phenomenon was portable to other organizational field if the resource conditions are similar. Of course, such a hypothesis remained untested due to lack of time and data, but it’s something I can put on my checklist.<br>

<br><br><br><h4>Takeaways: Curiosity, Flexibility and Love of Thinking</h4><br>

<br>Does the conclusion matter the most to an academic or a professional? Well, I needed my thesis to graduate so, yeah, it kind of does. However, it is the journey of experiencing a complete cycle of researching and producing publishable academic papers that gave me the most joy: formulating hypothesis, collecting data, conducting analysis, finding evidence to support/disapprove the hypothesis, doing meaningful interpretations and adjusting research methods as research progresses.<br>

<br>Despite later leaving academia for user research, as I realized that I wish to utilize my skills to make more direct impact over people’s life, the excitement of discovery and strong sense of curiosity remained and later became an inseparable part of me. More importantly, I gained a valuable lesson of being flexible: just like me designing mixed-research methods to cater my research on Chinese organizations, research and researchers need to be flexible of choosing the most fit tools to make planned research come true. It’s never about one’s research skills and arsenal, it’s about the process of doing most contextually-reasonable research, as well as contributing to the team.<br>

</ol><br>

<br>“There is an App for that.”<br>

<br>Every time I hear this sentence I sense a power of comforting. After all, in a world where new needs emerge constantly, constructed and reshaped by our social and technical environments, it makes us feel a bit better to know that each need of ours can be addressed by an App, hidden in the universe of applications. But, do they handle when and how you use it properly?<br>

<br>I am clearly aware that I am not the first person around to highlight the usage of technologies --- not even remotely close. But I am frustrated about how those aspects and considerations were thrown away when things are designed.<br>

<div class="wraptocenter">
    <br><img src="img/design/panel-flight.jpg" alt="an picture of bad design overlooking context of use" style="width: 70%;"><br><figcaption style="display: block; font-size: 0.7em; width: 67%; margin: auto;">Not a digital product but still pretty bad in terms of context of use. I shot this on the plane from Asia to Chicago.

Maybe I am the only one worrying about looking like a fool, but it was exactly how I felt when I struggled with this panel, and I was actually lucky enough to find this panel.</figcaption><br>
</div>

<br>This is why I place context of usage at the highest priority when I design my application for lending and leasing parking space in Ann Arbor. Surely, it is a school project completed within weeks, but the story and journey behind this process was what I eagerly want to share with you.<br>

<br><br><br><h4>Prologue: the problem of finding</h4>

<br>Like many college towns, Ann Arbor houses a large population of car owners. The construction of parking infrastructures fails to catch up with the surge of vehicles in the area. This, coupled with tidal waves of crowds entering the town for large social events such as football and art fairs, makes Ann Arbor a parking hell --- a place where no one can find slots to park when they need it.<br>

<br>Don’t get me wrong, I am not trying to play God or claiming that my application will magically make all those problems go away. As a matter of fact, before I intervene, people have spontaneously tried to handle the problem by themselves. The booming demand of short-term parking drives prices of parking space high in Ann Arbor. As the result, house or apartment owners try to lease out their unused parking space, while car owners desperately try to find and get those spaces. However, the problem is, they can’t do it so effectively and efficiently.<br>

<br>
<div style="display: table-cell; width: 100%;">
    <img src="img/design/demand.jpg" style="width: 49%;" alt="demand of parking leasing in Ann Arbor">
    <img src="img/design/supply.jpg" style="width: 48%;" alt="supply of parking leasing in Ann Arbor">
    <p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: center;">Supply and Demand for parking leasing. Not most efficient way of finding them though.</p>
</div>

<br>Craigslist, Facebook, word of mouth, massive spam emails, holding signs on the streets… People have tried many ways to get their information out, either for leasing or lending. But they all failed as current methods are too fragmental and costly, particularly time wise. Take the example of Craigslist as shown above, for sure car owners can publish their needs for a parking space, but that assumes house or apartment owners who have spare parking place go to the same platform and keep track of all similar posts. If Craigslist has a large number of posts under the same section that day, you’d better cross your fingers as your post will certainly be pushed down to the bottom of the list, and we all know that’s the tomb of any posts for any online forums. <br>

<br><br><br><h4>Chapter 1: the idea</h4>

<br>So here is the first and broadest function I set for my project: it needs to collect and distribute information centrally so that people could find what they need without break a sweat. It should also house information of parking despite of time elapses. To reach this target, I locked down to several alternatives to achieve the goal.<br>

<br>
<div style="display: table-cell; width: 100%;">
    <img src="img/design/parkme-sketch1.jpg" style="width: 49%;" alt="quick sketch 1">
    <img src="img/design/parkme-sketch2.jpg" style="width: 49%;" alt="quick sketch 2">
    <img src="img/design/parkme-sketch3.jpg" style="width: 49%;" alt="quick sketch 3">
    <img src="img/design/parkme-sketch4.jpg" style="width: 49%;" alt="quick sketch 4">
    <p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: center;">Quick sketches of 8 alternatives to solve the parking (leasing) issues in Ann Arbor.</p>
</div>

<br>Among all the options, I find the mobile application especially appealing because it offers flexibility and ease of access as a mobile app does --- not just because it’s an app and apps are what people do now. It breaks the restriction of space and time, so a parking space owner can publish his or her listing whenever and wherever he/she wants, and vice versa for the space seekers. In particular, a mobile app can better address one fundamental element that gives birth to Ann Arbor’s parking nightmare: people living outside Ann Arbor periodically adds extra burden to the parking situation in Ann Arbor. Compared to other options such as information kiosk, only a mobile application could give them the freedom to get the information they need before they even get to Ann Arbor. <br>

<br>But just finding information is not good enough, one also needs to communicate with the other party should some clarification needs to be done. Additionally, people should be allowed to secure the deal within the application. If not, one will only find themselves in an even more awkward position. For seekers, this will take place when they go to Ann Arbor and realize the spot they liked have been already taken by others and they need to restart their searching process. For owners, it will truly be a disaster if they save a spot for someone but that someone never shows up.<br>

<br>
<div class="wraptocenter">
    <img src="img/design/parkme-workflow.png" alt="workflow of the application that also indicates the information architecture"><br><figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.8em;">Workflow of the application (from bottom to top) that also indicates the information architecture.</figcaption><br>
</div>

<br>Hence the proposed the workflow. Users of my application may experience the process of find/search -> (communication) -> (reservation) -> navigation to complete their experience of parking their cars. A jump from this linear process is given to those who do not find communication or reservation necessary. More importantly, this workflow serves as the foundation of the information architecture of the application, which will later be used to determine the hierarchy of all information and how information will be presented to the users. In general, finding/searching functions will always take precedence as one needs it to make a reservation. Such a logic is crucial to the presentation of UI elements whenever a conflict emerged among information.<br>

<br>
<br><h4>Chapter 2: the context and the design</h4>

<br><h4>Users vs. Usage: Features and Contexts</h4>

<br>But what about contexts? How are contexts considered in the design process of my mobile application? What functions/features does the application need to help users to park easily? This is the part where it gets fun. <br>

<br>My thought process began long before I tried to formalize my strategy for the design. The concept of formulating a marketplace for both suppliers and consumers via a mobile platform is not new (cough Airbnb). So, naturally, I have a general idea of what may work for my users, as their expectations and mental model may be heavily influenced by successful applications of a similar kind out there in the market. Competitive analysis helped me to gain more detailed insights from existing solutions, but for a user base as “niche” as residents at Ann Arbor, I need some design guidelines specifically contextualized for them.<br> 

<br>After informal participatory observations and several explorative interviews, I have come to a preliminary conclusion that there are three categories of users who frequently drive to Ann Arbor for social events and may need parking leasing in advance: individuals, groups of friends and groups of families. Additionally, with the anticipated behavior of when users engage with the application to retrieve and manage short-term parking leases, I was able to determine  functions/features needed by the users. Hence the following matrix:<br>

<br>

</div><br>

<br>In terms of user groups, because users under the Friends and Families categories do not travel alone, they might need to share or forward information related to parking leases, such as time of reservation, to their companies. Therefore, it may be logical to include an integrated sharing function within the application.<br>

<br>Time-wise, the general trend is that the closer it gets to the first day of the lease, the more urgent it will be for the communications between the space seekers and the owners --- if such a communication is needed. Those seekers who plan ahead could afford the time to browse and exchange information with the owners, while those who need a parking urgently require more direct and less time-consuming communication methods.<br>

<br>In summary, contexts of how and when the users use the application dictates the functions/features needed. For users who need to park in Ann Arbor, functions such as sharing, fast searching, direct communication and in-app reservation and communication are essential and instrumental in aiding the users to park more easily.<br>


<br><br><br><h4>A new problem solved by an old idea: communication with parking owners</h4><br>

Now think about this, will you remember it every time to check on any applications before you leave for a place? Chances are we occasionally forget to act according to planned schedule, or we suddenly have the mood to do some impulsive actions. It may drive us nuts if we still need to follow a routine to complete the tasks we desire. <br><br>

</div>

<br>Let’s begin with login screen. Imagine you are a busy father who promised your spouse and your kids to watch football together on Saturday. Everything went well until you realized you forgot to take care of parking. To save yourself from nagging and “I told you so” bombardment, as well as unhappy children due to missing the first five minutes of the game because you couldn’t find a parking place, you decided to hide in the bathroom 10 minutes before the departure for Ann Arbor and try to get parking checked off from your list. In this case, any requirement of signing-up will be devastating and, please allow me to exaggerate a bit here, it could be a life and death matter. Therefore, I added the option to skip account registration and put it in a position easy to find for those who need it. Though doing so may potentially prevent the application from saving critical information for the users, the tradeoff is well worth it for scenarios where skipping is in dire need.<br>

<br>Ok, so you find your place and you have 6 minutes left. Now the next problem is that there are some minor questions you are not sure about the parking spot. You don’t want to risk it so you need to communicate with the parking space owner regarding your concerns. Although the application allows in-app communication but there is no way the parking place owner will answer your questions within that 6 minutes. What should you do? <br>

<br>My answer is an old fashioned one: a phone call. In this case, the context dictates that the speed of communication is the highest priority. In-app text communication takes too much time to get a response and thus never the one-fits-all solution for the application. Plus, nothing is more assuring than simply dial the number and talk to a real person about one’s issues, particularly when a quick answer is desired.<br>

<br>
<div class="wraptocenter">
    <img src="img/design/parkme-listing.png" style="width: 30%;" alt="checking the listing">
    <img src="img/design/parkme-calling.png" style="width: 30%; left: 8%;" alt="calling the parking space owner">
    <p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: center;">A call function is designed for those context where a call is the best communication method.</p>
</div>

<br>Thus I designed the app with the feature that allows users to directly contact the parking space owners. I purposely put the button next to the in-app communication system, which offers a centralized place for the parking seekers to reach to the owners. More importantly, it signifies the significance of “call an owner” function that it is not just something good to have, but an inseparable component of the application which allows the users to complete their tasks under any conditions and contexts. You see, a new problem not always require new solutions. Instead, as I firmly believe, old ideas may be equally powerful, if organized and presented properly to the users according to the contexts of usage.<br>

<br>
<br><h4>The problem of how to show</h4>

<br>Ok, now parking seekers have two ways to communicate with the owners, is this the end of story? Apparently no. As a matter of fact, I find it actually the beginning of another round of serious considerations. The problem is: In which form are these information shown to the users, and what is the architecture behind those information?<br>

<br>
<div class="wraptocenter">
    <img src="img/design/parkme-text.png" style="width: 30%;" alt="in-app text alert">
    <img src="img/design/parkme-text2.png" style="width: 30%; left: 8%;" alt="another in-app text alert">
    <p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: center;">Texts from in-app communicate takes highest priority, because finding a parking spot is the core of the core functions.</p>
</div>

<br>Above are my answers. They may seem nothing special --- and functionally, they aren’t. The tricky part is that I made these in-app text alerts on top of all visual elements, and they would never go away until they were confirmed to be viewed by the users. In other words, structurally speaking, those alerts were placed in the most upfront layer in the <span id="toggle-info-arc"><b>architecture of the app</b>.</span><br>

<div class="wraptocenter" id="info-arc-hide">
    <img src="img/design/parkme-workflow.png" alt="workflow of the application that also indicates the information architecture" style="width: 30%;">
    <br>
</div>

<br>The logic behind this strategy is simple: because it is in accordance with the workflow and the longitudinal order where different tasks take place. As you may recall the pyramid of workflow, for general users, finding a parking spot always takes place first before they review/reserve/navigate to the parking place. That is to say, all other tasks are dependent upon a successful search. Such a relatively linear progression demands that the application need to treat any search-related information or interactions with highest priority, hence my design decision.<br>

<br>
<br><h4>Chapter 3: Design User Experience to the Last Mile</h4>

<br>The last piece of this story is navigation. Perhaps for many of us, a solution may be never complete if it only provides us with information and points us to a direction without taking us there. For a parking application, the same applies. This is why I made features such as time-sensing, location-sensing and traffic estimation available to parking seekers, in order to help them manage when to leave as well as traffic conditions.<br>

<br>
<div class="wraptocenter">
    <img src="img/design/parkme-navigation.png" style="width: 40%;" alt="out-of-app notification">
    <p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: center;">Contextually aware: the app knows when to go given the traffic conditions around the user.</p>
</div>

<br>However, there is one interaction that I want to bring your attention to:<br>

<br>Imagine you arrive at the parking spot after 30 minutes of driving. During the process your phone has been in your pocket, or mounted on the dash serving as a GPS and music player. You are unsure about which space to park into and the owner is not around. So you need to contact him/her. Obviously you need to give him/her a call, so you rummaged through your pocket/purse looking for your phone, or you took your phone off the car mount and click through a pile of installed application in your phone, just to look for the contact button in the parking application.<br>
<br>
<div class="wraptocenter">
    <img src="img/design/parkme-arrival.png" style="width: 40%;" alt="out-of-app notification2">
    <p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: center;">Contextually aware: users' arrival is automatically sent to the parking space owner, saving time and hassle of going through the app again.</p>
</div>

<br>Obviously this is not the ideal way to get you to the parking owners. Any additional physical actions are not only redundant but also potentially dangerous given you may be not fully parked. So I designed two ways to work around the problem:<br>
<br><ol>1. The application itself senses your distance to the parking space and notifies the owner upon your arrival. This may release you from the hassle of telling your location to the owner by yourself.</ol>
<ol>2. In any case if simple arrival notification is not enough, the application offers an option to put you in contact with the owner --- all in the format of an interactive notification.</ol><br>

<br>
<div class="wraptocenter">
    <img src="img/design/parkme-arrival-closein.png" style="width: 60%;" alt="out-of-app notification2">
    <p style="font-size: 0.8em; text-align: center;">The call function is conveniently placed within the interactive notification.</p>
</div>

<br>I can talk one hour about the advantages of such a design choice, but, deep down, the reason is simple: I have been there. I know it sucks to find crucial information in last-minute context, particularly when the whole line was waiting for me at the cashier while I was desperately trying to find the digital membership card I stored in my phone. Putting my users to the similar situation will devastate me. My interactive notification design may not be the perfect solution for all scenarios. Yet, it marks my effort to solve similar problems, as well as my eternal empathy to those who ever feel powerless in face of ever-evolving technologies.<br>

<br><br><p style="font-size: 0.8em;">Notes: a small usability testing session has been carried out during the design process, before wireframes are turned into prototypes. A sample video is available to view under the research project section.<p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
