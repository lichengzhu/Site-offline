# Version 1.0 Goes Online
The framework has done! For now I have included four major components: <br>
<br>
homepage <br>
UX research <br>
design <br>
a about page <br> 
<br>
I might replace the "design" page with a blog, but it is still under planning. More interesting content is coming! Can't wait to see the final version!
